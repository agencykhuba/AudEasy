# Database Authentication Issue - Resolution Report

## Problem
Database authentication failing with error: "password authentication failed for user audeasy_db_user"

## Root Cause
Using incorrect password from Render UI (`gPGHjHhaUKw3cuTVEc9KLHTYuI7UW8P8`) instead of actual password set during database creation (`GaelRafa91072834`)

## Solution
Updated web service DATABASE_URL to use correct password:
`postgresql://audeasy_db_user:GaelRafa91072834@dpg-d352di8dl3ps738adjkg-a.oregon-postgres.render.com/audeasy_db`

## ELF Framework Application
This incident perfectly demonstrates why Evidence-Led Fixing is critical:
- Should have asked "What password did you set?" first
- Would have identified correct password in minutes
- Instead spent hours chasing UI-displayed credentials

## Status
✅ RESOLVED - Database connection verified working
✅ Health endpoint returning HTTP 200 with "database: connected"
✅ Permanent solution confirmed - no credential rotation issues
