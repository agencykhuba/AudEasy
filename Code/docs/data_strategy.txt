# Data Strategy for AudEasy

- Objective: Maintain clean and reliable audit data for the MVP.
- Rules:
  - Check for duplicates in the 119 checklist items manually every week.
  - Validate all user inputs (e.g., yes/no responses, remarks) for consistency before submission.
  - Flag incomplete audits (less than 50% of 119 items) for review.
- Future Plan: Automate import validation and duplicate detection post-MVP using Google Sheets integration.
