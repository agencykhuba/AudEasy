        "Store Selection and Audit Data Entry: Ability to select a store from a dropdown (using the 58 stores listed in the TBL sheet) and enter checklist data via yes/no checkboxes for the core categories (Customer Delight & Ops Excellence, Admin & Financial Control, People Development & QA Compliance). Include minimal fields like remarks. (Why: Streamlines audits for 58 stores, reduces manual errors, and enables quick data capture for 119 checklist items.)",
        "View Audit List/Summary: A basic list or summary view of submitted audits, showing scores or completion status per category (e.g., total/actual/% from the Summary sheet). (Why: Provides Area Managers with instant insights, aiding decision-making and tracking progress across stores.)",
        "Basic Data Submission and Storage: Secure submission of entered data to a backend (e.g., SQLite or simple database), with offline draft saving if possible. (Why: Ensures data integrity and availability, supporting offline audits in areas with poor connectivity.)"

Managers currently use AM'SExcellenceChecklist-Rev.xlsx with 119 items across categories like Customer Delight & Operations Excellence, Admin & Financial Control, and People Development & QA Compliance, facing inefficiencies such as slow entry, errors, delayed insights, and tracking issues across 58 stores and 5 managers. AudEasy offers secure login, store selection, and structured data entry for instant submissions, summaries, and reports, cutting completion time by 50%. Built on a scalable backend (e.g., Python/FastAPI with PostgreSQL), it ensures data accuracy, offline support, and Excel migration. It empowers managers with actionable insights via CAR plans, boosting operational excellence, food safety, and decision-making.",
