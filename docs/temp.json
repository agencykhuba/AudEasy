    "problem_statement": "AudEasy solves manual audit tracking by providing a simple digital tool for Area Managers to streamline restaurant performance evaluations, replacing cumbersome Excel-based checklists with an intuitive mobile app. In the current setup, as detailed in the AM's Excellence Checklist analysis, managers rely on spreadsheets like AM'SExcellenceChecklist-Rev.xlsx, which include over 119 checklist items across categories such as Customer Delight & Operations Excellence, Admin & Financial Control, and People Development & QA Compliance. This manual process leads to inefficiencies: time-consuming data entry, error-prone calculations (e.g., compliance scores from 18-40 items per category), delayed insights, and challenges in tracking trends across 58 stores and 5 Area Managers. Paper or Excel audits also hinder real-time collaboration, increase compliance risks in food safety (e.g., HACCP deviations outlined in the CAR Corrective Action Plan), and make it difficult to implement corrective actions promptly. AudEasy addresses these pain points by digitizing the workflow into a mobile-first platform with secure login, store selection, and structured data entry for yes/no responses and remarks. Users can submit audits instantly, view basic summaries, and generate simple reports, reducing completion time by up to 50% as targeted in the success criteria. Built on a scalable backend (e.g., Python/FastAPI with PostgreSQL), it ensures data accuracy, offline capabilities, and easy migration from existing Excel data. Ultimately, AudEasy empowers managers to focus on actionable improvements, like root cause analysis for non-conformances (e.g., via integrated CAR plans with sections for identification, root cause, and verification), fostering better operational excellence, food safety compliance, and decision-making in fast-paced restaurant environments.",
