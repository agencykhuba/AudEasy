# CRITICAL: Local Development Setup Failure - Post-Mortem Analysis

**Document Type:** Incident Report & Prevention Protocol  
**Date:** September 23, 2025  
**Phase:** 7D - Quick Audit Implementation  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**QOSA Score:** 45/100 (POOR)

## Executive Summary

AudEasy reached 60% completion without a functional local development environment. All testing was conducted directly on production, violating industry standards.

## Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys)

1. **Why was local dev non-functional?** Directory `code/` conflicts with Python stdlib module
2. **Why wasn't this caught?** Focused on production deployment only
3. **Why prioritize production?** Visible milestone seemed more important
4. **Why no verification?** No "development readiness" checklist existed
5. **ROOT CAUSE:** Confused "code running somewhere" with "proper development environment"

## The Cost

- **60+ hours** wasted on slow Render deployments
- **15+ hours** inefficient production debugging  
- **100% untested code** deployed (Phase 7D Quick Audit)

## The Solution

**Immediate:** `run_local.py` workaround (working now)  
**Proper Fix:** Rename `code/` to `app/` in Week 4 (October 2025)

## Lessons Learned

1. Local development is NOT optional
2. Never name directories after stdlib modules (code, test, email, xml)
3. Production success ≠ development environment success
4. QOSA violated: chose speed over quality

## Prevention Protocol

**Day 1 Checklist for ALL future projects:**
- [ ] Local dev server runs successfully
- [ ] Tests execute locally
- [ ] Debugger works
- [ ] All team members can run locally

**Workflow:** Write → Test Locally → Commit → Deploy

## Refactoring Schedule

- **Now:** Use `run_local.py` for all local testing
- **Week 3:** Create test suite, staging environment
- **Week 4 (Oct 14):** Rename `code/` to `app/`, full refactor
- **Week 5:** Validation and documentation update
